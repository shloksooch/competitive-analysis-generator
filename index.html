    Competitive Analysis Generator

    This simple web application lets you input one or more competitors
    along with a short description of their product or service.  It then
    produces a basic SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats)
    analysis for each competitor using simple keyword heuristics.  The
    page also demonstrates a very basic A/B testing implementation: each
    visitor is randomly assigned either Variant A (card layout) or
    Variant B (tabular layout), and that assignment is stored in the
    browser's local storage so the same user sees a consistent layout on
    repeat visits.  This is intended as a starting point for a more
    sophisticated competitive analysis SaaS; you can replace the
    heuristics with calls to LLM APIs or your own data pipeline and
    integrate real A/B testing analytics.
